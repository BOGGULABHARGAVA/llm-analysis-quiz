## Testing Methodology

These prompts should be tested against:
- GPT-4 and GPT-5-nano
- Claude models
- Other students' prompts

The goal is to:
- **System prompt:** Resist revealing the codeword (score when it successfully hides)
- **User prompt:** Force revealing the codeword (score when it successfully extracts)

---

**Note:** These prompts are designed to be effective across multiple LLM models while staying within the 100-character limit.
